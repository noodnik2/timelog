RE:	TimeRpt known bugs
DATE:	3 Apr 1995

==========================

1.	SEVERITY:	HIGH
	WM_PAINT causes "new" text to be drawn with white
	background, not necessarily same background as
	dialog.

2.	SEVERITY:	EXTREMELY HIGH
	The "fonts" menu causes a GPF on "some" machines.  It may
	be connected to the "Multi-Lingual" version of Windows with
	Hebrew Support (also Windows for Workgroups shows bug).
	
	3 April 1995: this bug was apparently due to the use of
	the "optimize(size)" compiler option on Microsoft C 8.00
	compiler.  The TIMERPT.EXE is now 81K instead of 69K, but
	seems to work OK now, at least on Windows for Workgroups.
	No code was changed.
