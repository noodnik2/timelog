RE:	Known problems in TimeLog/TimeRpt 1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES:
(1)	TimeLog is Copyright (C) 1994 by Marty Ross, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
(2)	TimeLog requires Microsoft Windows 3.1 or compatible.


The following problems are known, and will be fixed in decreasing order
of severity in future releases of TimeLog/TimeRpt:


TimeLog problems:

(1)	PROBLEM SEVERITY: LOW
	When a user returns to Windows from a DOS-window, the
	TimeLog icon is not immediately updated.  Not an excuse,
	but note that the MS-Windows Clock also exhibits this
	behavior.

(2)	PROBLEM SEVERITY: LOW
	Because TimeLog only records time allocated on a project
	when the project is closed (or TimeLog is closed), time
	allocated to a project is lost when the user exits Windows
	in a non-conventional way, such as a power-loss, or a crash
	(non-recoverable GPF, etc).

	WANTED: SOLUTION
	Upon initialization, TIMELOG should check that the project
	last opened was successfully closed.  If not, it should prompt
	the user to enter an adjustment.  Currently, TimeLog does not
	warn the user about projects opened but not closed.


TimeRpt problems:

(1)	PROBLEM SEVERITY: VERY HIGH
	When the "User Name" is not defined, the "Report Header"
	section is not printed.

(2)	PROBLEM SEVERITY: HIGH
	Paging up and down in report is very slow.

(3)	PROBLEM SEVERITY: HIGH
	The background color for text in the report window is not
	set correctly when the report is redrawn due to WM_PAINT
	messages.

(4)	PROBLEM SEVERITY: MEDIUM
	Time allocated to the currently "active" project since it
	was last opened is not reflected in the report.

(5)	PROBLEM SEVERITY: MEDIUM
	Font selection is not currently being stored in the
	initiazation file.  This means that user needs to respecify
	font selection each time before printing.

(6)	PROBLEM SEVERITY: MEDIUM
	The initial font selection (default printer font) cannot be
	restored after selecting a new font in the "Options:Fonts..."
	menu action.

(7)	PROBLEM SEVERITY: MEDIUM
	No mention is made, even in the most detailed report, of
	irregularities in the log file such as projects that were
	opened and not closed, etc.
