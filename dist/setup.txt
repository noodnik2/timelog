RE:	Setting up the TimeLog Program
------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES:
(1)	TimeLog is distributed as a self-extracting MS-DOS archive.
(2)	TimeLog is Copyright (C) 1994 by Marty Ross, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
(3)	TimeLog requires Microsoft Windows 3.1 or compatible.


To setup TimeLog for the first time, follow the procedure below:

(1)	Enter Microsoft Windows 3.1 or compatible.
(2)	Enter a DOS session from within Windows (steps 3-4 are performed
	in DOS).
(3)	Create a sub-directory anywhere in your directory tree called TIMELOG.
(4)	Change to this new directory, and execute the TimeLog distribution
	self-extracting archive program.  This will copy all of the necessary
	TimeLog files into the current directory.
(5)	Toggle back to Windows, and create a "TimeLog" group in the Program
	Manager by selecting "File", "New", "Program Group", and specify
	"TimeLog" as the description.
(6)	Create a "TimeLog" item in the new group, again by selecting "File",
	"New", but this time "Program Item", and again specify "TimeLog" as
	the description.  Fill in "timelog.exe" for the command line, and
	give the full path of the new TIMELOG directory you created in
	step (3) above as the working directory.
(7)	Create a "TimeLog Help" item in the new group by selecting "File",
	"New", "Program Item", and specify "TimeLog Help" as the description.
	Fill in "winhelp timelog.hlp" for the command line, and give the full
	path of the new TIMELOG directory you created in step (3) above as
	the working directory.
(8)	Locate and open your "Startup" group by double-clicking on the
	"Startup" group icon.  Position the group window so that you can
	still see the TimeLog program item that you created in step (6),
	above.
(9)	Make a copy of the TimeLog program item (step 6, above), by clicking
	on the "TimeLog" program icon, holding down the "Ctrl" key, and
	dragging (a copy of ) the TimeLog program item into the Startup
	group.  When you release the mouse (stop dragging), you should see
	two copies of the TimeLog program icon: one in the TimeLog group,
	and the other in the "Startup" group. 

If all steps above are executed successfully, then TimeLog is installed.
The next time you start Windows, TimeLog will become active.

Since initially there are no projects defined, you might want to start
TimeLog manually at this point (by double-clicking on the TimeLog program
icon), and define at least one project by pressing the "New" button in the
"Project" group.  You should select the newly created project to be your
"Current Project", and optionally also your "Overhead Project".  See the
"Projects" entry of the help file for more information about projects.

Note that context-sensitive help can be invoked in TimeLog and TimeRpt
at all times by pressing F1.

*** NOTE!:	Because of a known bug in TimeRpt (see BUGS.TXT), the
		header section will not appear in your reports until you
		define your user name.  Select "Options:User Name..."
		in the TimeRpt dialog.
