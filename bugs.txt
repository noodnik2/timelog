RE:	TimeLog known bugs
DATE:	13 Nov 1994

==========================

(1)	PROBLEM SEVERITY: LOW
	When a user returns to Windows from a DOS-window, the
	TimeLog icon is not immediately updated.  Not an excuse,
	but note that the MS-Windows Clock also exhibits this
	behavior.

(2)	PROBLEM SEVERITY: LOW
	Because TimeLog only records time allocated on a project
	when the project is closed (or TimeLog is closed), time
	allocated to a project is lost when the user exits Windows
	in a non-conventional way, such as a power-loss, or a crash
	(non-recoverable GPF, etc).

	WANTED: SOLUTION
	Upon initialization, TIMELOG should check that the project
	last opened was successfully closed.  If not, it should prompt
	the user to enter an adjustment.  Currently, TimeLog does not
	warn the user about projects opened but not closed.
